# Summary
The tyssue library seeks to provide a unified interface to implement bio-mechanical models of living tissues. It's main focus is on vertex based epithelium models. tyssue allows to model 2D, apical 3D epithelium or full 3D epihelium based on two kind of resolutions : quasi-static equilibrium of a potential energy or a viscous solver following Euler resolution.

[...]
The author has used tyssue in several studies of epithelium morphogenesis, such as leg folding and mesoderm invagination in *Drosophila melanogaster*. (**Monier**, **Gracia**, **Martin**)

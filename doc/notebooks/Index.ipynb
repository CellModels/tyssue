    "The `tyssue` library seeks to provide a unified interface to implement\n",
    "bio-mechanical models of living tissues, with a focus on **epithelium** modeling.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What kind of Models does it implement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model implemented is the one described in\n",
    "Monier et al. [monier2015apico]. It is an example of a vertex model,\n",
    "where the interactions are only evaluated on the apical surface sheet\n",
    "of the epithelium. The second class of models are still at an\n",
    "stage. They implement a description of the tissue's rheology, within a\n",
    "dissipation function formalism.\n",

    "The mesh structure is heavily inspired by\n",
    "[CGAL Linear Cell Complexes](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Linear_cell_complex/index.html),\n",
    "most importantly, in the case of a 2D vertex sheet for example, each\n",
    "junction edge between the cells is \"splitted\" between two oriented **half\n",
    "edges**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Structure of the modeling API\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the tyssue library rests on two structures: a set of\n",
    "`pandas DataFrame` holding the tissue geometry and associated data,\n",
    "and a nested dictionnary holding the model parameters, variables and default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tyssue data structure](illus/tyssue_data_management.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The API thus defines an `Epithelium` class. An instance of this class\n",
    "is a container for the datasets and the specifications, and implements\n",
    "methods to manipulate indexing of the dataframes to ease calculations.\n",

    "The graphic below details the various objects modeled here. Each of those are implemented as an abstract class. If one considers the model in Monier et al. [monier2015apico], the apical sheet is consituted of vertices and edges, representing apical junctions. This geometry can be generalized to model 3D columnar cells constituted of apical, basal and equatorial meshes, linked by sagital edges. Depending on the model, a subset of those junctions will be used. Each cell interacts with its neighbour through its junctions. An epithelium is then a graph of interacting cells, with two cells neighbouring cells sharing a junction.\n",

    "There are two interesting libraries to deal with the objects we whish to consider. The first one, [`CGAL::Polyhedron`](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Polyhedron/index.html) can only represent surfaces, and can't be used for the general 3D tissue. The second one, [`CGAL::LinearCellComplex`](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Linear_cell_complex/group__PkgLinearCellComplex.html) is suited for all our models. The `Polyhedron` model is simpler though, and there's a [function](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Linear_cell_complex/group__PkgLinearCellComplexConstructions.html#ga9239e988c6d5e674d64438d47b95a548) that can create `LCC` objects form `Polyhedron` instances. In order to ease the porting of the `leg-joint` simulations to the new architecture, we'll first develop this model within the `Polyhedron` framework, and then generalized with the LCC.\n",

With this concept, individual cells as well as the whole epithelium are represented by a LCC. As can be seen by browsing the above linked documentations, this very general framework provides efficient ways to represent the tissue and common events such as cell division (using lcc.insert_point_in_cell). For a given model, only subsets of these objects might be needed, but we'll try to keep the various definitions as generic as possible, for example by defining cell division irrespective of the detailed geometry of the cell, through template meta-programming\n",

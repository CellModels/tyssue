    "The graphic below details the various objects modeled here. Each of those are implemented as an abstract class. If one considers the model in Monier et al. [monier2015apico], the apical sheet is consituted of vertices and edges, representing apical junctions. This geometry can be generalized to model 3D columnar cells constituted of apical, basal and equatorial meshes, linked by sagital edges. Depending on the model, a subset of those junctions will be used. Each cell interacts with its neighbour through its junctions. An epithelium is then a graph of interacting cells, with two cells neighbouring cells sharing a junction.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the physical objects are represented by CGAL Linear Cell Complexes - in short LCC, that are specialized versions of CGAL Combinatorial Maps. Vertices are 0-cells (associated to a Point object in the LCC), edges 1-cells, facets are 2-cells and volume are 3-cells [1]. With this concept, individual cells as well as the whole epithelium are represented by a LCC. As can be seen by browsing the above linked documentations, this very general framework provides efficient ways to represent the tissue and common events such as cell division (using lcc.insert_point_in_cell). For a given model, only subsets of these objects might be needed, but we'll try to keep the various definitions as generic as possible, for example by defining cell division irrespective of the detailed geometry of the cell, through template meta-programming\n",

The advantage of LCC over halfedges is it's extensibility to 3 dimentions and dimention agnostic aspects.\n",

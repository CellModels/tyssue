## Installing tyssue with conda

If you already have a conda environment ready:
```
conda install -c glyg tyssue
```

## From the beginnig

Those are the instructions to install the package from source on a
debian-like linux distribution. If you allready have a basic
scientific python stack, use it, don't install anaconda.


###Â Get and intall Anaconda

Go to http://continuum.io/downloads and grab anaconda for your architecture.


```bash
bash Anaconda3-2.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
source .bashrc # update your PATH
```

If you don't want the whole distrib, you can alternatively download
[miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)

### Create a virtual environment with `conda`

```bash
conda create -n tyssue python=3.4 numpy scipy vispy matplotlib pytest tables numexpr
## activate the new environment
source activate tyssue
```

### Install with conda

```
conda install -c glyg tyssue
```

### Alternative: Download and install `tyssue` from source

If you want to do that, I assume you allready know how to manage
dependencies on your platform.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CellModels/tyssue.git
cd tyssue/
python setup.py install
```

If all went well, you have successfully installed tyssue.

A `Makefile` provides some utility function. Try :

```sh
make flake8  # Check PEP8 on the code
make tests  # Run tests with nose
make coverage  # Run tests with coverage
```

### Conda build

You can build a conda binary :

```sh
conda build conda-recipe/
```

### Building the documentation

The documentation uses
[nbsphinx](http://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.2.9/index.html) to
convert the jupyter notebooks in doc/notebooks to html with sphinx.


```sh
pip install sphinx nbsphinx sphinx-autobuild
cd tyssue/doc
make html
```
